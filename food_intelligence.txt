Food and Beverages



Aim of project
1) Menu ingredients will attract customers
2) Ingredients and Recipe ratio will taste better 

1) Clasification for food taste 
2) Text Summarization for food articles, Food reviews
3) Chatbot for interation with customers with variations in taste

question 5 items 

Recipies option 

Dataset 5 recipes
LSTM model 
structure query: food items used, recipe, inredients,    question , Answer
100000 food articles with 100 categories

Its Interesting
Goals:
As eveyone know Food carries its own memory 
What food doesnt matters but combinations of what, where , when we consume that for always there is combination of quantity  and ratios of ingredients, recipes contributions to tastes

Target:

Our clients, which was from various food industries, consumable 5 stars hotels.
To develop better food reviews , customer attraction systems: Proportions of various recipes ,Interative Menus,Chatbots for interaction and better understanding consumer needs

On basis of this Datasets were  
We started getting Datasets from various with From clients we recieved some recipes,menus,Amazon food reviews, Food Articles From various  magazine            

Data cleansing
Extraction of food details using Lemmatization,Punctuation,NER techniques, Regular Expression, Menu contents in 1/2 cups, spoonfull, No of Word 1==one , 


Dataset preparation   
Summary for various food articles --build datasets

goal : To predict the food on basis of taste,ingredients,recipes

Features used no of orders, Ingredients quantity,recipe name, Taste

contributions
various quantities, Ratios of ingredients   

Two types it was unstructured as well as structured
 
ML Algorithms 
Unstructured
1) Kmeans : Classes defined Taste,popularity with regions. 
2) Topic modelling : Prices

Structered
Features, Labels 

NLP 
1) Ngrams after Probabilistic Models (Conditional) <--- eg : Paneer  also it was identified data for sequence models, LSTM, 
Chatbot we were designing Transformer

2) we have demo 1st MVP(Client Representation),we showcased using Dashboards,Frontend pages semi workable models data 

3) Then we started Decision Tree,Gradients Boosting, Adaboost, XG boost


Decision tree: Models working Features used wrt data, Activation functions, loss functions, Adams Optimization   


Callenges : 





Questions
Features selection : Using Dependency of various features (Pearson corelation)
Word2vec: Skip gram and CBOW, TF-IDF

Food carries memory and energy by itself
quantification of each every ingredients into recipes makes its incredible,delicious,mouthwatering, enjoyable

creating trasprancy with customers and detailing reviews 
1) Creating interative menus with specified recipes giving transperancy, reviews --1.5 to 2

Combining food with increadients 
combination of foods increadients or recipes create exceptional thought process

in more generalize i can it can thought process for each food element that is been 
 Morphology : 
Vegetables

Spices and Herbs
Cereals and Pulses
Meat
Dairy Products
Fruits
Seafood
Sugar and Sugar Products
Nuts and Oilseeds
